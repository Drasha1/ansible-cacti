Cacti
  Overview
    this is a basic cacti server that graphs cpu, memory, load average, and eth trafficthis is a basic cacti server that graphs cpu, memory, load average, and eth trafficthis is a basic cacti server that graphs cpu, memory, load average, and eth trafficthis is a basic cacti server that graphs cpu, memory, load average, and eth traffic
    snmp3 is used to get data from the server
    this role can be run on any servers you want to monitor and you specify the cacti server with the cacti group and run this role on it for setup

  Requirements
    snmp3 must be configured on the server you are monitoring. I have a snmp repo that will do this for you if you need it
    mysql or mardiadb for storage
    a my.cnf file in /root so auto login is possible
    epel repos

  Ansible Variables
    mysql_cacti_password=password  || has to be set for the cacti server
    htaccessuser=cacti             || user for login to cacti only needed on cacti server
    htaccesspass=password          || password for login to cacti only needed on cacti server
    snmp3user=snmpuse              || needed for servers being graphedr
    snmp3password=snmppass         || needed for servers being graphed

  Files
    /usr/share/cacti/               || web directory
    /usr/share/cacti/cli            || cli scripts
    /var/log/cacti/cacti.log        || cacti error log

  Ports
   outgoing udp on port 23
   outgoing snmp tcp on port 161
   in coming tcp to snmpd on port 199
   in/out tcp to httpd on port 80
   in/out tcp to mysql on port 3306

  Resources
    http://www.cacti.net/downloads/docs/html/cli_add_graphs.html || manually adding graphs. good for troubleshooting setup issues

  Basic Tasks
    Add user
      add htaccess information to /var/www/htpasswd/users
      no additonal cacti information is needed as cacti is configured to not use access control at the moment

    Adding server to monitor
      use the ansible cacticlient role to automatically setup a server for this
      manually via cli (replace HOSTNAME, IPADDRESS, and DEVICE-ID should be replaced with the output of the first command)
        cd /usr/share/cacti/cli/
        php -q add_device.php --description="HOSTNAME" --ip="IPADDRESS" --template=9 --community="vwr24bruread" --version=3 | grep "device-id"
        php -q add_graphs.php --host-id=DEVICE-ID --graph-type=cg --graph-template-id=4
        php -q add_graphs.php --host-id=DEVICE-ID --graph-type=cg --graph-template-id=11
        php -q add_graphs.php --host-id=DEVICE-ID --graph-type=cg --graph-template-id=13
        php -q add_graphs.php --host-id=DEVICE-ID --graph-type=ds --snmp-query-id=1 --snmp-query-type-id=13 --snmp-field=ifOperStatus --snmp-value=Up  --graph-template-id=32
        php -q add_tree.php --type=node --node-type=host --tree-id=1 --host-id=DEVICE-ID
          The last add_graph command can fail if snmp isn't configured correctly in which case it won't see a eth port to configure this for
          note this is dependent on a custom template being added for ventrilo. the ansible setup should have added this.

    Disable cacti
      vim /etc/cron.d/cacti || comment out the cacti poller line then disable web access for cacti
